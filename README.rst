Introduction
============
`:information_source:` 

 I ported the different steering behaviors implemented as C# (+ Unity) code from Paul Roberts' book `Artificial Intelligence in Games <https://www.routledge.com/Artificial-Intelligence-in-Games/Roberts/p/book/9781032033228>`_ to 
 JavaScript using the ``phase.js`` 2D game development library.
 
- The author Paul Roberts implemented the steering behaviors in C# using the Unity game engine.
- The author used zombies invading a shopping mall in search of fresh brains as a backdrop for a simple game where you will
  implement and test different steering behaviors exhibited by the horde of zombies. 
  
  In the C# game, each zombie is represented as a green dot
  on the screen and can be spawned at specific places and at a certain rate during the game. The user controls a 
  black dot that can shoot at the zombies with the spacebar.

   - In the JavaScript port, green balls serve as a substitute for zombies.
   - Also for some of the steering behaviors, the user can control a red "zombie". For example, in the case of the 
     `avoidance JavaScript implementation <#in-javascript-a-port-of-paul-roberts-c-implementation-of-avoidance>`_, 
     the user can move the red "zombie" anywhere on the canvas and the green "zombies" will try to avoid it like any other
     obstacles.

`:information_source:` 

 I ported the steering behaviors implemented in C# (+ Unity) code from Paul Roberts' 
 book `Artificial Intelligence in Games <https://www.routledge.com/Artificial-Intelligence-in-Games/Roberts/p/book/9781032033228>`_ to 
 JavaScript using the ``phase.js`` 2D game development library.
 
**JavaScript port:** you can run the JavaScript code (which uses ``phaser.js``) through your browser via codepen.io

- `codepen.io <https://codepen.io/raul23/full/KKxQKzK>`_ (fullscreen)
- `codepen.io <https://codepen.io/raul23/pen/KKxQKzK>`_ (source code)

- The author Paul Roberts implemented the steering behaviors in C# using the Unity game engine.
- Each steering behavior has as an associated weight. These are the default values:

  - Arrive weight: 0.5
  - Avoidance weight: 0.75
  - Flee weight: 0.5
  - Flocking weight: 0.25
  - Seek weight: 0.5
  - Wander weight: 0.25
- The user can control a red "zombie" (.i.e. ball) with the arrow keys and can move it anywhere around the
  canvas so that the other green "zombies" can use it as a target to avoid or follow.
  
  In the case of the `avoidance behavior <#in-javascript-a-port-of-paul-roberts-c-implementation-of-all-steering-behaviors>`_, 
  eventually they will cease all movement once they reach an
  equilibrium state where all green "zombies" will be piled on top of each other.

- The author Paul Roberts implemented the wandering algorithm in C# using the Unity game engine.
- Wandering is part of many other kinds of **steering behaviors** (e.g. flocking or evading) and hence has a weigth associated

  take into account the other behaviors.
- When the program starts, I give a **random facing direction** to each green "zombie" unlike in the book's C# code where
  each zombie starts with a default right facing direction (i.e. a ``(1,0)`` vector). Hence, the zombies wander in all kinds of direction 
  (left, top, right, bottom) instead of collectively wandering toward the right of the screen.
